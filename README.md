# Java Spring Boot Backend

## Overview

This repository contains the backend code for our school group project, developed using Java Spring Boot. 
The backend is designed to support a React + Vite frontend application (hosted in a separate repository). 
It provides RESTful APIs for handling data and business logic.

### Project Goals

- **Robust API**: Develop a RESTful API to serve as the data layer for the frontend application.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Implement a scalable and maintainable architecture using Spring Boot.
- **Secure and Performant**: Ensure the backend is secure and performs efficiently under load.

## Teamwork Insights

As mentioned earlier, this project was carried out as a team effort. The collaborative nature of this project offered valuable insights and experiences, including:

- **Enhanced Problem-Solving Skills**: Working together allowed us to tackle complex problems more effectively and find creative solutions.
- **Diverse Perspectives**: Team members brought diverse viewpoints and expertise, which enriched the development process and led to more robust and innovative solutions.
- **Improved Communication**: Regular meetings and discussions improved our communication skills and facilitated better coordination between frontend and backend development.
- **Learning Opportunities**: Collaborating on this project provided hands-on experience with Java Spring Boot, React, and Vite, as well as insights into best practices for building and integrating full-stack applications.

Overall, this team-based approach not only achieved our project goals but also significantly contributed to our growth as developers and our understanding of real-world software development practices.

### Using Scrum Methods

As part of the project, we implemented well-known Scrum methods to improve our development process:

- **Sprints**: We organized our work into time-boxed sprints, typically lasting two weeks. This helped us focus on specific features and deliverables within manageable periods.
- **Daily Stand-ups**: We held daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, identify blockers, and plan the day's work. This practice kept everyone aligned and responsive to any issues that arose.
- **Sprint Planning and Reviews**: At the beginning of each sprint, we planned our tasks and set clear goals. At the end of each sprint, we reviewed our progress, demonstrated completed work, and gathered feedback for improvements.
- **Retrospectives**: After each sprint, we conducted retrospectives to reflect on what went well and what could be improved. This continuous feedback loop allowed us to refine our processes and enhance team collaboration.

Overall, using Scrum methods significantly enhanced our ability to manage the project efficiently, deliver features on time, and adapt to changes dynamically.
